## What is CloudZero?

CloudZero is the only cloud cost intelligence platform that puts engineering in control by connecting technical decisions to business results.:

- [Cost Allocation And Tagging](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/allocation) Organize and allocate cloud spend in new ways, increase tagging coverage, or work on showback.
- [Kubernetes Cost Visibility](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/kubernetes) Understand your Kubernetes spend alongside total spend across containerized and non-containerized environments.
- [FinOps And Financial Reporting](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/finops) Operationalize reporting on metrics such as cost per customer, COGS, gross margin. Forecast spend, reconcile invoices and easily investigate variance.
- [Engineering Accountability](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/engineering) Foster a cost-conscious culture, where engineers understand spend, proactively consider cost, and get immediate feedback with fewer interruptions and faster and more efficient innovation.
- [Optimization And Reducing Waste](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/optimization) Focus on immediately reducing spend by understanding where we have waste, inefficiencies, and discounting opportunities.
