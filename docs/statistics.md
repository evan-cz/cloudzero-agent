# CloudZero Insights Controller Prometheus Statistics

## /metrics Endpoint

The `/metrics` endpoint is exposed to provide Prometheus-style metrics. This endpoint is designed to be scraped by Prometheus to collect various statistics about the CloudZero Insights Controller.

### Features

- **Standard Metrics**: Includes default metrics provided by the Prometheus client libraries.
- **Custom Metrics**: Additional application-specific metrics to monitor the performance and health of the CloudZero Insights Controller.

### Usage

To access the metrics, simply make an HTTP GET request to the `/metrics` endpoint:

```
GET /metrics
```

### Example

```sh
curl https://<controller-pod-ip>:8443/metrics
```

Replace `<controller-pod-ip>` with the appropriate values for your deployment. You may need to use port forwarding to access the pod directly from your local machine.

### Integration with Prometheus

The Insights Controller deployment includes:

- [Kubernetes Service](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/blob/release/1.0.0/charts/cloudzero-insights-controller/templates/service.yaml)
- [ReplicaSet](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/blob/release/1.0.0/charts/cloudzero-insights-controller/templates/deploy.yaml#L7) - the Insights Controller application. [ReplicaSet](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/blob/release/1.0.0/charts/cloudzero-insights-controller/templates/deploy.yaml#L9) defaults to 3.

To integrate with Prometheus, add the following job configuration to your Prometheus configuration file. This configuration leverages Kubernetes service discovery to automatically find and scrape all instances of the CloudZero Insights Controller.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "cloudzero-insights-controller"
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: endpoints
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_label_app]
        action: keep
        regex: cloudzero-insights-controller
```

#### Namespace and Labels

Note that the above assumes the target is uniquely identified by the label `app=cloudzero-insights-controller`, modification may be necessary to perform service discovery accross different namespaces in the `relabel_configs` section for a custom scrape configuration.

### Metrics Overview

The `/metrics` endpoint provides a variety of metrics, including but not limited to:

- **HTTP request durations**
- **Error rates**
- **Resource usage**

These metrics help in monitoring the health and performance of the CloudZero Insights Controller, enabling proactive issue detection and resolution.

## Metrics, Gauges, and Histograms

The default Prometheus registry in Go, when using the Prometheus client library, automatically exposes a set of standard metrics related to the Go runtime and process. These metrics provide insights into the performance and behavior of the Go application and the underlying system. Below are the key metrics that are auto-exposed:
